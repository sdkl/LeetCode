Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.



Input:Digit string "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
Note:
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

思路：
没什么难的，注意手机键盘按键字符分布规律，1没字母，7和9是4个字母，其他按键3个字母
